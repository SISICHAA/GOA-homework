Georgia is a small country located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, in the Caucasus region. It borders Russia to the north, Turkey and Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the east. The capital city is Tbilisi.

Georgia is known for its beautiful mountains, ancient history, and unique culture. The Georgian language has its own alphabet, and the country is famous for its hospitality, wine-making, and delicious food like khachapuri and khinkali.

It’s also one of the world’s oldest Christian nations — Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century.</p>
