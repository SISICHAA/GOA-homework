Turkey is a country that lies partly in Europe and mostly in Asia, making it a bridge between the two continents. It borders countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The capital city is Ankara, but the largest and most famous city is Istanbul.

Turkey has a rich history, once being the center of the Byzantine and later the Ottoman Empire. Itâ€™s known for its beautiful mosques, ancient ruins, and unique culture that mixes Eastern and Western traditions.

Turkish food, such as kebabs, baklava, and Turkish tea, is popular around the world. The country is also famous for landmarks like Hagia Sophia, Cappadocia, and Pamukkale.</p>
